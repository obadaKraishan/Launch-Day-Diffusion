A fully reproducible demonstration system that tracks how Hacker News (HN) exposure translates into GitHub star growth for AI and LLM tools. This pipeline analyzes launch-day dynamics and identifies key predictors of viral growth using event study methodology and machine learning.

**Author**: Obada Kraishan, Texas Tech University

## 🎯 Key Findings

Our analysis of 138 repository launches (2024-2025) reveals:
- **Immediate Impact**: Repositories gain an average of 121 stars within 24 hours, 189 stars within 48 hours, and 289 stars within a week of HN exposure
- **Timing Matters**: The difference between optimal and suboptimal posting hours is ~200 stars
- **Best Window**: 12-17 UTC consistently outperforms other time slots
- **Show HN Paradox**: The "Show HN" tag shows no statistical advantage after controlling for other factors

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
```bash
python >= 3.8
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/obadaKraishan/icwsm-hn-github.git
cd icwsm-hn-github
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Environment Setup
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Add your GitHub token (optional but recommended for higher rate limits)
echo "GH_TOKEN=your_github_token_here" >> .env
```

### Run Complete Pipeline
```bash
# Run all scripts in sequence (takes ~5 minutes)
make demo

# Or run individual components
python src/01_collect_hn_posts.py --start 2024-01-01 --end 2025-01-01
python src/02_extract_github_repos.py
# ... etc
```

## 📊 Pipeline Overview

The system consists of 10 modular scripts that can be run independently or as a complete pipeline:

| Script | Purpose | Output |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `01_collect_hn_posts.py` | Fetch HN posts linking to GitHub | `hn_posts.csv` |
| `02_extract_github_repos.py` | Parse GitHub owner/repo from URLs | `github_repos_from_hn.csv` |
| `03_github_repo_metadata.py` | Fetch repository metadata | `github_repos_metadata.csv` |
| `04_github_stars_timeseries.py` | Get time-stamped star events | `stars_timeseries.csv` |
| `05_build_event_windows.py` | Align timeseries to HN post time | `event_windows.csv` |
| `06_feature_engineering.py` | Create modeling features/labels | `features_labels.csv` |
| `07_event_study_plots.py` | Generate event study curves | Event study figures |
| `08_model_star_growth.py` | Train predictive models | Model predictions & metrics |
| `09_ablation_checks.py` | Run robustness checks | Ablation estimates |
| `10_make_report_txt.py` | Generate summary report | `REPORT.txt` |

## 🔬 Methodology

### Event Study Design
- **Window**: ±7 days around HN post time (t=0)
- **Alignment**: Hourly star counts aggregated to daily totals
- **Labels**: Δ24h, Δ48h, Δ168h star gains

### Models
- **Elastic Net**: Interpretable linear relationships with L1/L2 regularization
- **Gradient Boosting**: Captures non-linear patterns and interactions
- **Validation**: 80/20 train-test split with 5-fold cross-validation

### Statistical Tests
- OLS regression with heteroscedasticity-robust standard errors (HC1)
- Controls for baseline repository characteristics
- Multiple model specifications for robustness
